R-E-0001: = Euchre =
R-E-0002: 
R-E-0003: Conventional euchre is a four-player trump game, wherein the players are paired 
R-E-0004: to form two partnerships. Partners face each other from across the table so that
R-E-0005:  the play of the cards in conventional clockwise order alternates between the 
R-E-0006:  two partnerships.

Players are laid out in an alternating team 1 - team 2 - team 1 - team 2 pattern

R-E-0007: 
R-E-0008: Conventional euchre uses a deck of 24 standard playing cards consisting of A, K, 
R-E-0009: Q, J, 10, and 9 of each of the four suits. A standard 52-card deck can be used, 
R-E-0010: omitting the cards from 2 to 8, or a Pinochle deck may be divided in half to 
R-E-0011: form two euchre decks. In some countries, the common 32-card piquet or Skat 
R-E-0012: deck is used, which includes the 7s and 8s.

We use the 9-10-J-G-K-A version.

R-E-0013: 
R-E-0014: To determine the first deal, many players use a first Jack deals or first black 
R-E-0015: Jack deals rule. Using the euchre deck, one player will distribute the cards, 
R-E-0016: one at a time, face up in front of each player. The player dealt the first 
R-E-0017: (black) jack becomes the dealer for the first hand. In subsequent hands, the 
R-E-0018: deal is rotated clockwise. Out of courtesy, the dealer should offer a cut to 
R-E-0019: the player on his right after shuffling and immediately before dealing.

In this version, "Player 2" will deal first, and the winner of each round thereafter deals

R-E-0020: 
R-E-0021: Each player is dealt five cards (or seven if using the 32-card deck) in 
R-E-0022: clockwise order, usually in groups of two or three cards each. The dealer may 
R-E-0023: alternate, first giving two cards to the player to his left, three cards to his 
R-E-0024: partner, two cards to the player on his right and three cards to himself. The 
R-E-0025: dealer then repeats, this time giving three cards to the player on his left, two 
R-E-0026: cards to his partner and so on, to give each player the requisite five cards. 
R-E-0027: Some dealers prefer to deal going down or up such as 4-3-2-1 then 1-2-3-4, 
R-E-0028: although it doesn't matter what order the cards are dealt in as long as each 
R-E-0029: person gets 5 cards.

Each person gets 5 random cards. We don't simulate anything as complex as card deal order.

R-E-0030: 
R-E-0031: The remaining four cards are called the kitty, but are sometimes referred to as 
R-E-0032: the kit, the widow, the blind, the dead hand, the grave, or buried and are 
R-E-0033: placed face down in front of the dealer toward the center on the table. The top 
R-E-0034: card of the kitty, sometimes referred to as the deck head, or the "up card" is 
R-E-0035: then turned face up, and bidding begins. The dealer asks each of the other 
R-E-0036: players in turn if they would like the suit of the top card to be trump, which 
R-E-0037: they indicate saying "pick it up" and the top card becomes part of the dealer's 
R-E-0038: hand, who then discards to return his hand to five cards. If no one "orders up"

The dealer does not pick up or discard any cards at this point in this implementation.
 
R-E-0039: the top card, each player is given the opportunity in turn to call a different 
R-E-0040: suit as trump. If no trump is selected, it is a misdeal, and the deal is passed 
R-E-0041: clockwise unless it was agreed upon to play screw the dealer, an option that 
R-E-0042: involves forcing the dealer to choose a trump (see the Bidding section in Euchre 
R-E-0043: variations).

In this variation, the turn to call suit just goes around the party ad naseum.

R-E-0044: 
R-E-0045: When a suit is named trump, any card of that suit outranks any card of a 
R-E-0046: non-trump suit. The highest ranking card in euchre is the jack of the trump suit 
R-E-0047: and is referred to as the right bower, or simply the right. Next highest is the 
R-E-0048: other jack of the same color, the left bower. The right and left may also be 
R-E-0049: known as the "jack" and the "jick", the "right bauer" and "left bauer," or 
R-E-0050: "jack" and "off jack" respectively. Remaining cards of the trump suit rank from 
R-E-0051: high to low as A, K, Q, 10, and 9.
R-E-0052: 
R-E-0053: In non-trump suits (except for the next suit), the jacks are not special, and 
R-E-0054: the cards of those suits rank from high to low as A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9.
R-E-0055: 
R-E-0056: == Example ==
R-E-0057: 
R-E-0058: Assume a hand is dealt and that spades are named as trump. In this event, the 
R-E-0059: trump cards are as follows, from highest ranking to lowest:
R-E-0060: 
R-E-0061: Jack of spades (right bower)
R-E-0062: Jack of clubs (left bower)
R-E-0063: Ace of spades
R-E-0064: King of spades
R-E-0065: Queen of spades
R-E-0066: 10 of spades
R-E-0067: 9 of spades
R-E-0068: 
R-E-0069: For the purpose of play, the jack of clubs becomes a spade during the playing of 
R-E-0070: this hand. This expands the trump suit to the seven cards named above and 
R-E-0071: reduces the suit of the same color (sometimes referred to as the next suit) by 
R-E-0072: one card (the jack is "loaned" to the trump suit). The same principles are 
R-E-0073: observed for whatever suit is named trump. Remembering this temporary transfer 
R-E-0074: of the next suit's jack is one of the principal difficulties newcomers have with 
R-E-0075: the game of euchre (See Cheating: Renege, below).
R-E-0076: 
R-E-0077: Once the above hand is finished, the jack of clubs ceases to be a spade and 
R-E-0078: becomes a club again unless spades are again named as trump during the playing 
R-E-0079: of the subsequent hand.
R-E-0080: 
R-E-0081: = Play =
R-E-0082: 
R-E-0083: == Objective and scoring ==
R-E-0084: In euchre, naming trump is sometimes referred to as "making," "calling," or 
R-E-0085: "declaring trump". When naming a suit, a player asserts that his or her 
R-E-0086: partnership intends to win the majority of tricks in the hand (3 of 5 with a 
R-E-0087: 24-card deck, 4 of 7 with 32 cards). A single point is scored when the bid 
R-E-0088: succeeds, and two points are scored if the team that declared trump takes all 
R-E-0089: five tricks. A failure of the calling partnership to win three tricks is 
R-E-0090: referred to as being euchred (also called "getting set" or "getting bumped," 
R-E-0091: again depending on geographical location) and is penalized by giving the 
R-E-0092: opposing partnership two points. A caller with exceptionally good cards can go 

Currently there is no logic to favor the side not calling suit or to reward domination.

R-E-0093: alone, or take a loner hand, in which case he or she seeks to win all five 
R-E-0094: tricks without a partner. The partner of a caller in a 'go alone' hand does not 
R-E-0095: play, and if all five tricks are won by the caller the winning team scores four 
R-E-0096: points. If only three or four of the tricks are taken while going alone, then 
R-E-0097: only one point is scored. If euchred while playing alone, the opposing team 
R-E-0098: still only receives two points. (In some places, a euchred lone player is worth 
R-E-0099: 3 points.) There is a recognised option to defend alone, i.e. to attempt to 
R-E-0100: euchre the player going alone by a single player - while difficult, successfully 
R-E-0101: done this is an 8 point hand and will virtually guarantee a win.

"Going alone" is not supported

R-E-0102: 
R-E-0103: The primary rule to remember when playing euchre is that one is never required 
R-E-0104: to trump, but one is required to follow suit if possible to do so: if diamonds 
R-E-0105: are led, a player with diamonds is required to play a diamond. This differs from 
R-E-0106: games such as pinochle.
R-E-0107: 
R-E-0108: = Calling (naming trump) =
R-E-0109: 
R-E-0110: Once the cards are dealt and the top card in the kitty is turned over, the 
R-E-0111: upturned card's suit is offered as trump to the players in clockwise order 
R-E-0112: beginning with the player to the left of the dealer. If a player wishes the 
R-E-0113: proposed suit to be trump and has a card of that suit their hand (Note: the 
R-E-0114: opposite jack, not yet being of the same suit, does not qualify), he orders up 
R-E-0115: the dealer (or the dealer picks up).

The dealer does not draw the face-up card. It only seeds the first hand.

R-E-0116: 
R-E-0117: If each player passes in this round, the top card is turned face down and that 
R-E-0118: suit may no longer be chosen as trump. Trump selection proceeds clockwise 
R-E-0119: beginning with the player to the left of the dealer. The dealer is not ordered 
R-E-0120: up in this round. If no suit is chosen in this round, the cards are reshuffled 
R-E-0121: and the deal passes to the player on the dealer's left.
R-E-0122: 
R-E-0123: The team that selects trump is known as the "makers" for the remainder of the 
R-E-0124: hand. The opposing team is known as the "defenders" for the remainder of the 
R-E-0125: hand. The makers must take at least three of the five tricks in the hand in 
R-E-0126: order to avoid being euchred. If one of the players does not have an ace or a 
R-E-0127: face card or any trump cards, they may choose to call "no ace, no face, no 
R-E-0128: trump", in which case the hand is dissolved and the deal is passed on to the 
R-E-0129: player to the left of the current dealer (This rule is not observed in many 
R-E-0130: areas and is purely optional).

There is no "echred" rule, and no redraw based on "no ace, ..."

R-E-0131: 
R-E-0132: In the second round rules are:
R-E-0133: 
R-E-0134: The suit is required to be in the hand of the calling player 
R-E-0135: (Not recognised in some regions)
R-E-0136: 
R-E-0137: In the final round of bidding, the dealer is forced to choose a suit instead of 
R-E-0138: passing the deal to the person on his left (called "stick it to the dealer")
R-E-0139: 
R-E-0140: = Winning tricks =
R-E-0141: 
R-E-0142: The player to the dealer's left begins play by leading a card. (In some 
R-E-0143: variations, if any player is going alone, the player to that person's left will 
R-E-0144: lead.)

The first hand is led by the person to the left of the person who makes the trump suit.

R-E-0145: 
R-E-0146: Play continues in clockwise order; each player must follow suit if they have a 
R-E-0147: card of the suit led. The left bower is considered a member of the trump suit 
R-E-0148: and not a member of its native suit.

The left bower does not act as trump suit.

R-E-0149: 
R-E-0150: The player who played the highest trump wins the trick. If no trump were played, 
R-E-0151: the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. Players who play neither the 
R-E-0152: suit led nor trump cannot win the trick. The player that won the trick collects 
R-E-0153: the played cards from the table and then leads the next trick.

Currently any suit can win, a undocumented suit order is used when there is no traditional
winner

R-E-0154: 
R-E-0155: After all five tricks have been played, the hand is scored. The player to the 
R-E-0156: left of the previous dealer then deals the next hand, and the deal moves 
R-E-0157: clockwise around the table until one partnership scores 10 points and wins the game.

Play stops at the 5 tricks, where winnings are dispersed and players can redeal.  

R-E-0158: 
R-E-0159: = Going alone/solo =
R-E-0160: 
R-E-0161: If the player bidding (making trump) has an exceptionally good hand, or if his 
R-E-0162: or her partnership is in danger of losing the game unless they are able to score 
R-E-0163: points quickly, the player making trump has the option of playing without his or 
R-E-0164: her partner. If the bidder playing alone wins all five tricks in the hand, the 
R-E-0165: team scores four points.
R-E-0166: 
R-E-0167: "Going alone", "Going Solo", or "playing a lone hand" is initiated at the time 
R-E-0168: the bidder orders the upturned card on the kitty to the dealer (on the first 
R-E-0169: round of bidding) or names a suit (during the second round of bidding). The 
R-E-0170: bidder signifies his/her desire to play alone by stating "alone" or (for 
R-E-0171: example) "clubs alone" or "clubs solo" after bidding. If the dealer selects the 
R-E-0172: top card, she may also declare a loner hand by sliding her discard to her 
R-E-0173: partner. The bidder must make this call before play begins. During a loner, the 
R-E-0174: bidder's partner discards his or her cards, and does not participate in play of 
R-E-0175: the hand.

There is no "going alone" optiion in this game

R-E-0176: 
R-E-0177: Another regional variation, especially popular in Canada, and therefore 
R-E-0178: sometimes referred to as 'Canadian Rules', is that if the partner of the dealer 
R-E-0179: "orders him/her up" (forcing the dealer to pick up the turned card) during the 
R-E-0180: initial bidding, then the dealer is automatically forced out, and the dealer's 
R-E-0181: partner plays a lone hand.
R-E-0182: 
R-E-0183: Depending on regional rules, the lead on the first trick will either remain with 
R-E-0184: the player to the left of the dealer, or switch to the player to the left of 
R-E-0185: the bidder.
R-E-0186: 
R-E-0187: The odds of success of a loner bid depend on the lay of the cards and the 
R-E-0188: inactive cards held by the bidder's partner. Nine cards out of twenty-four do 
R-E-0189: not participate in play, making the hand less predictable than otherwise. A 
R-E-0190: hand consisting of the top five cards of the trump suit is mathematically 
R-E-0191: unbeatable from any position; this is sometimes referred to as a lay-down, as a 
R-E-0192: player with such a hand may often simply lay all five cards on the table at 
R-E-0193: once.
R-E-0194: 
R-E-0195: The rules of an individual game may state that a player who "sweeps," or wins 
R-E-0196: all 5 tricks while going alone/solo gets 4 points, 2 for sweeping and 2 for 
R-E-0197: going alone.
R-E-0198: 
R-E-0199: One of the opponents of the lone bidder may say "I defend alone", and his 
R-E-0200: partner must stay out. The lone defender will play alone. Scoring is similar 
R-E-0201: in such a case to a loner hand. Any "set" or "euchre" by a single defender 
R-E-0202: going alone is worth 4 points to the defending partnership, or 3 in some 
R-E-0203: regions.
R-E-0204: 
R-E-0205: Scoring
R-E-0206: Scoring in Euchre	Points
R-E-0207: Bidding partnership (makers) wins 3 or 4 tricks	1
R-E-0208: Bidding partnership (makers) wins 5 tricks	2

R-E-0215: Lone defender (vs. lone bidder) wins 3 or more tricks	8 †
R-E-0216: † regional variation
R-E-0217: 
R-E-0218: The first team to score 15 (sometimes 5, 7, 10, or 11) points wins the game 
R-E-0219: (sometimes called a round). While score can be kept by using a tally sheet, most 
R-E-0220: euchre players traditionally use the pair of 5 cards for one member of each 
R-E-0221: partnership to keep score. In Western New York and parts of Ohio, it is 
R-E-0222: traditional to use 2 and 3 cards, crossing them to show scores higher than 5. 
R-E-0223: In some parts of Ohio a 6 and a 4 are used. In all cases, one card is used to 
R-E-0224: cover the other so as to expose the number of pips corresponding to the team's 
R-E-0225: score. A lone defender winning 3, 4, or 5 tricks (known as a march) gets 4 
R-E-0226: points.

Score is not kept beyong the 3-out-of-5-tricks match. 

R-E-0227: 
R-E-0228: An alternative scoring system removes the point system entirely. Instead of 
R-E-0229: points, only euchres (or "Euchs") are counted. These are when the "defenders" 
R-E-0230: fail to earn a single trick, or when the "makers" fail to get three tricks (or 
R-E-0231: two tricks if trump was forced). A match can be the first to 3 or 5 "Euchs". 
R-E-0232: This simplicity can enhance the enjoyment of play. The "all or nothing" element 
R-E-0233: of this system may enhance the game's drama.
