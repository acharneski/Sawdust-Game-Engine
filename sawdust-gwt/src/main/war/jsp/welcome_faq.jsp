<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h2>What is the Sawdust Game Engine?</h2>

We are a new site offering a variety of card games including Blackjack, Poker, and Euchre.
You can play these games with any web browser, and even on your mobile phone. 

<h2>Do I need to log in?</h2>
If you access us via <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/sawdust-games/">Facebook</a>, authentication happens automatically.
Otherwise, you can use your existing google account to log in. Of course, you could also play as a guest and not log in at all!

<h2>Do I need online friends and/or credits to play games?</h2>

No! Games can be played with no-bet settings, and AI players are always availible. 
If you want to play with random humans, you can also create a public game and wait for players to join. 

<h2>How can I report bugs, give feedback, and get help?</h2>

We are a very new site, and we plan to add many new games and game options in the near future.
Please check back in often and, if you can find a moment, let us know what you think!
